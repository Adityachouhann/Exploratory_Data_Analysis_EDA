# üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Workflow

This notebook performs a complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and preprocessing pipeline on a structured dataset using Python and standard data science libraries. The goal is to understand the data distribution, clean and preprocess it, visualize important patterns, and prepare it for machine learning model building.

## üßæ Steps Followed in the EDA Process

### 1. Data Loading and Initial Inspection
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas`.
- Inspected data using `.head()`, `.shape`, `.info()`, and `.describe()` to understand structure and summary statistics.
- Checked column data types and overall structure.

### 2. Missing Value Analysis and Treatment
- Identified missing values using `isnull().sum()`.
- Handled missing values:
  - For **categorical columns**, filled with mode.
  - For **numerical columns**, filled with mean or median depending on distribution.

### 3. Univariate Analysis
- Used count plots for categorical variables to see frequency distributions.
- Plotted histograms for numerical variables to observe distribution and skewness.
- Identified skewed variables.

### 4. Bivariate Analysis
- Analyzed relationships between input features and target variable using:
  - Count plots grouped by the target.
  - Box plots to compare numerical distributions across classes.
  - Crosstab and groupby analysis for categorical interactions.

### 5. Outlier Detection and Handling
- Visualized outliers using box plots.
- Applied transformations (like log transformation) to reduce skewness and normalize distributions.
- Optional: Capped extreme outliers based on domain knowledge.

### 6. Correlation Analysis
- Generated a correlation heatmap using `seaborn.heatmap()` to identify relationships between numeric features.
- Used correlation matrix to remove or combine redundant features.

### 7. Feature Engineering
- Applied **Label Encoding** to convert categorical variables into numeric.
- Performed **log transformation** on skewed numerical features to normalize them.
- Ensured all data was in numeric form for model input.

### 8. Train-Test Split
- Split the processed dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from Scikit-learn.

### 9. Model Building (for initial validation)
- Built baseline machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Evaluated models using accuracy and classification report.
